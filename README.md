# Project 2 - *Flixster*

**Flixster** shows the latest movies currently playing in theaters. The app utilizes the Movie Database API to display images and basic information about these movies to the user.

Time spent: **15** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] User can **scroll through current movies** from the Movie Database API
* [x] Display a nice default [placeholder graphic](https://guides.codepath.org/android/Displaying-Images-with-the-Glide-Library#advanced-usage) for each image during loading
* [x] For each movie displayed, user can see the following details:
  * [x] Title, Poster Image, Overview (Portrait mode)
  * [x] Title, Backdrop Image, Overview (Landscape mode)
* [x] Allow user to view details of the movie including ratings and popularity within a separate activity

The following **stretch** features are implemented:

* [x] Improved the user interface by experimenting with styling and coloring.
* [x] Apply rounded corners for the poster or background images using [Glide transformations](https://guides.codepath.org/android/Displaying-Images-with-the-Glide-Library#transformations)
* [x] Apply the popular [View Binding annotation library](http://guides.codepath.org/android/Reducing-View-Boilerplate-with-ViewBinding) to reduce boilerplate code.
* [x] Allow video trailers to be played in full-screen using the YouTubePlayerView from the details screen.

## Notes

I found it difficult to understand intent at first, but I am understand it better now. I also had trouble using the API keys in my secrets.xml file because I didn't realize that if I wanted to declare a constant with the URL, I would have to append my API key later on when I was making my API call because constants cannot have the reference to the API key. I also struggled a little bit with the API call to the movie database because I had implemented it in the wrong place.
